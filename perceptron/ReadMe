Perceptron classifiers (vanilla and averaged) to identify hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive, and either positive or negative.


The learning program will be invoked in the following way:

> python perceplearn.py /path/to/input

The argument is the directory of the training data; the program will learn perceptron models, and write the model parameters to two files: vanillamodel.txt for the vanilla perceptron, and averagedmodel.txt for the averaged perceptron. 

The classification program will be invoked in the following way:

> python percepclassify.py /path/to/model /path/to/input
