Perceptron classifiers (vanilla and averaged) to identify hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive, and either positive or negative.

Training Data:
A top-level directory with two sub-directories, one for positive reviews and another for negative reviews (plus license and readme files).
Each of the subdirectories contains two sub-directories, one with truthful reviews and one with deceptive reviews.
Each of these subdirectories contains three subdirectories, called “folds”.
Each of the folds contains 80 text files with English text (one review per file).

Test Data:
A top-level directory with two sub-directories, one for positive reviews and another for negative reviews 
Each of the subdirectories contains two sub-directories, one with truthful reviews and one with deceptive reviews.
Each of these subdirectories contains one subdirectories, called “folds”.
Each of the folds contains 80 text files with English text (one review per file).

The learning program will be invoked in the following way:

> python perceplearn.py /path/to/input

The argument is the directory of the training data; the program will learn perceptron models, and write the model parameters to two files: vanillamodel.txt for the vanilla perceptron, and averagedmodel.txt for the averaged perceptron. 

The classification program will be invoked in the following way:

> python percepclassify.py /path/to/model /path/to/input
