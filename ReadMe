This repository contains my mini natural language processing projects.

The purpose of these projects is to get myself familiar with common NLP techniques and practice my coding skills. All programs were developed with Python Standard Library.
Projects:

name_predictor: A simple rule-based predictor to predict the full names of the first person given a string representing the names of two persons.

lemmatizer: A simple lemmatizer that learns a lemmatization function from an annotated corpus and maps every word form attested in the training data to the most common lemma associated with that form.

naive_bayes: A Naive Bayes Classifier that classifies hotel reviews into 4 categories: positive and truthful, positive and deceptive, negative and truthful, negative and deceptive.

percptron: A program that implements both Vanilla Percptron Classifier and Averaged Perceptron Classifier that classifies hotel reviews into 4 categories: positive and truthful, positive and deceptive, negative and truthful, negative and deceptive.

hidden_markov_model: A program that implements Hidden Markov Model for Part of Speech Tagging.
